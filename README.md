# Flipper Zero BadUSB scripts
A collection of mostly harmless BadUSB scripts for the Flipper Zero.
Made out of boredom, updated whenever I feel like it.

Feel free to tweak, remix, or build on anything here. There’s no license on this repo — do what you want with it. Just don’t expect support or explanations.

I’m not responsible for how you use any of these scripts. Use common sense.

More scripts and content will be added over time. Or not. Depends.
